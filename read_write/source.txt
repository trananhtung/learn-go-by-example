The Reader interface specifies a single method called Read. This method takes a byte slice p as a parameter and returns the number of bytes read (n) and an error (err). The purpose of this interface is to provide a way to read data from a source, such as a file or network connection. Any type that implements the Read method with the specified signature can be considered a Reader and used interchangeably with other Reader types.
The Writer interface, on the other hand, declares a single method called Write. This method takes a byte slice p as input and returns the number of bytes written (n) and an error (err). The purpose of this interface is to provide a way to write data to a destination, such as a file or network connection. Any type that implements the Write method with the specified signature can be considered a Writer and used interchangeably with other Writer types.
